        Four years ago, I decided to pursue my passion for IT and decided to
        finish my studies. After that, it has been a roller coaster in terms of
        learning, opportunities, amazing colleagues and friends that I met and
        they help me improve so much. I am glad that I took that decision, and I
        want to keep pushing forward to gain more experience and achieve my
        goals. My area of focus lies in developing web and mobile products as
        well as cloud technologies (AWS) and Data with Python. I enjoy
        developing new products and improving the quality of existing ones,
        working in teams to iterate and improve the experiences that reach
        business goals.
