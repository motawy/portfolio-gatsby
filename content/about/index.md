Four years ago, I decided to pursue my passion for IT and decided to
finish my studies. After that, it has been a roller coaster in terms of
learning, opportunities, amazing colleagues and friends that I met and
they help me improve so much.

I am glad that I took that decision, and I
want to keep pushing forward to gain more experience and achieve my
goals. My area of focus lies in developing web and mobile products as
well as cloud technologies (AWS).

I enjoy developing new products and improving the quality of existing ones,
working in teams to iterate and improve the experiences that reach
business goals.
