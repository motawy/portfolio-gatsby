aboutSubtitle: "Who am I?"
aboutText: "Four years ago, I decided to pursue my passion for IT and decided to
  finish my studies. After that, it has been a roller coaster in terms of
  learning, opportunities, amazing colleagues and friends that I met and
  they help me improve so much. I am glad that I took that decision, and I
  want to keep pushing forward to gain more experience and achieve my
  goals. My area of focus lies in developing web and mobile products as
  well as cloud technologies (AWS) and Data with Python. I enjoy
  developing new products and improving the quality of existing ones,
  working in teams to iterate and improve the experiences that reach
  business goals."
